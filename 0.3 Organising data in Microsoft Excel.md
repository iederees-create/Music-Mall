    Double-click on the "CustomerId" column heading to select it, then click on the Italic button to make the text italicized. Similarly, select cell A2,
  click on the Italic button to make the text italicized, and then use the paintbrush formatting tool to apply the same format to the rest of the cells in Column A.

    Click on cell B2, then click on the View tab, and select Freeze Panes. Choose the "Freeze Panes" option to freeze the top row and left column.

    Click on any cell within the dataset, then click on the Data tab, and select Sort. In the Sort dialog box, select the "LastName" column as the sort 
  criteria and choose "A to Z" as the order. Click on OK to apply the sort.

    Select the cells in the "State", "PostalCode", "Phone", and "Fax" columns, then click on the Home tab, and select Find & Select > Go To Special.
