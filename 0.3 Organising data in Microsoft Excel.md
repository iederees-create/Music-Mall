Next we going to format Music Malls's invoice data by applying the following formating instructions

  1. Apply conditional formatting to the "Total" column so that the top 10 sales are highlighted in green. 

2. Insert a column to the left of the "InvoiceDate" column and give it the heading "InvoiceMonth". Use the paintbrush function to copy the heading row formatting.

3. For the cells in the new column, make them reference the "InvoiceDate" cell in the corresponding row (i.e. Cell C2 must reference Cell D2).

4. Format the "InvoiceMonth" column to the custom format mmm-yy.

5. Filter the data set to only show invoices for August and September 2012.
  
 To organise the data in worksheet with the given instructions:

    Select the "Total" column (Column F) and apply conditional formatting by going to Home > Conditional Formatting > Top/Bottom Rules > Top 10 Items. Choose the "Light Green Fill with Dark Green Text" option and click OK.

    Right-click on the "InvoiceDate" column (Column D) and select "Insert". A new column will be inserted to the left of the "InvoiceDate" column.

    In cell C2, enter the formula "=D2". This will reference the value in the "InvoiceDate" column for that row. Copy this formula down to the rest of the cells in Column C by selecting the cell and dragging the small blue square in the bottom right corner of the cell down to the last row.

    Select the "InvoiceMonth" column (Column C) and format it to the custom format "mmm-yy" by going to Home > Number > Custom and entering "mmm-yy" in the Type box.

    Click on the filter button on the top right corner of the table. In the "InvoiceDate" column, deselect "Select All" and then select only "Aug-12" and "Sep-12". This will filter the table to show only the invoices for August and September 2012.
