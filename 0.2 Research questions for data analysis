Case study:
Multiple customers have launched complaints that searching for and purchasing music from Music Mall is confusing and laborious.
The management executives recognise this as a major problem, as they pride themselves on putting their customers first. 
Therefore, they decide that the IT team should update the user interface, and streamline their platforms to make them more user-friendly.
Before the IT team can redesign the platform, the company decides to do in-depth research into the problem, in order to guide the web designers.

Below are three specific research questions that the company could propose in order to guide the IT team during the redesign process.
One descriptive, one relational, and one causal question. Each question is clearly defined as whether it is a descriptive, relational, or causal question.

Descriptive Research Question:
What are the current pain points that customers face when searching for and purchasing music on Music Mall's platforms?
Type of question: Descriptive

Relational Research Question:
Is there a correlation between the complexity of the user interface and the frequency of customer complaints?
Type of question: Relational

Causal Research Question:
How does simplifying the user interface of Music Mall's platforms affect customer satisfaction and sales?
Type of question: Causal

Take either the relational or causal research questions and identify some of the most relevant variables for that question. 
Indicate which variables are the dependent, independent, and control variables. 

Relational Research Question:

    How does the ease of searching and purchasing music on Music Mall's platform affect customer satisfaction?

Dependent variable: Customer satisfaction
Independent variable: Ease of searching and purchasing music on Music Mall's platform
Control variables:

    User demographic (age, gender, location, etc.)
    Music genre preferences
    User device (mobile, desktop, tablet)

It is important to control for variables that could potentially influence the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
In this case, controlling for user demographic, music genre preferences, and user device can help ensure that any observed relationship between ease 
of use and customer satisfaction is not due to these other factors.

Once the variables have been identified, it is important to determine how these variables will be measured and how the data will be gathered. 
Remember that data can be primary- or secondary source data. 

The relational research question is: "Is there a relationship between the length of the music search process and customer satisfaction?"

The dependent variable is customer satisfaction, which will be measured on a Likert scale through a survey questionnaire.
This is an example of primary source data since the company will gather the data directly from the customers.

The independent variable is the length of the music search process, which will be measured as the time taken for a customer to find a specific song or album. 
This will be tracked automatically by the Music Mall platform and recorded in the company's database.
This is an example of secondary source data since the company will gather the data from their own platform.

Control variables may include the customer's age, gender, and familiarity with using technology.
These will be measured through the same survey questionnaire used to measure customer satisfaction. 
This is an example of primary source data since the company will gather the data directly from the customers.

To measure customer satisfaction, Music Mall will use a Likert scale questionnaire with questions such as 
"How satisfied were you with your overall experience searching for and purchasing music on Music Mall?" and 
"How likely are you to recommend Music Mall to a friend?" 
The length of the music search process will be measured by recording the time taken for a customer to find a specific song or album, 
which is automatically tracked by the Music Mall platform. 
The control variables will be measured through demographic questions on the same survey questionnaire used to measure customer satisfaction.
